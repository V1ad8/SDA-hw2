Note:
* Had to add specific functions for the queue and the linked list because I need them to contain structures that contained strings and needed special treatment (i. e. the structures had to be copied/freed one field at the time), most of these functions are almost identical to their general counterparts, co I've only added comments to the different parts.

Bibliography:
* The skeleton for the task 'courses.c' form the 7th lab: the implementations for the linked list, queue and hashtable (because they are borrowed, I did not add comments).
